The difficulty here is the density of asteroids (stars and aliens). You only have three heart points despite the difficulty, so more enemies, more difficult the game will become.

## Shoot the stars and get the points!

You will lose your points if you mistakenly shoot aliens as they are friends of the rabbit. Be nice to them!
